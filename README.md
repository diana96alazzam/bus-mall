# Bus-Mall

BusMall is a startup whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog, wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interests before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

This app displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) and they have to choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, results don't show to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

The results track the number of times the product has been viewed and clicked.
